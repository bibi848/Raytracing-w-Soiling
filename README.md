**Raytracing Simulations on CSP Panels by Oscar Djuric**

This repository contains scripts and files which use the HelioSoil library [1] to model the effect of soiling on the efficiency of a linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. <br><br>


To pull updates from the HelioSoil Repository to the Raytracing-w-Soiling Repository, write this in your git terminal:

*cd HelioSoil*

*git pull origin main*

*cd ..*

*git add HelioSoil*

*git commit -m "Updated HelioSoil submodule"* <br><br>


When collaborators would like to clone this repository, you will need to initialize and update the submodule via:

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bibi848/Raytracing-w-Soiling.git
